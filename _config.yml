# Navigation links for the sidebar (The 'minimal' theme displays these as text in the left sidebar)
# The theme uses the 'github:' section to display the links that appear under your name/pic.

# Adding the Links
# The 'minimal' theme uses the 'show_downloads' flag to enable the sidebar links.
# These will appear under the "View My GitHub Profile" link.
show_downloads: false

# Define your other links to display
# We'll use the jekyll-theme-minimal's feature to add extra links here.
# Note: This is an undocumented feature of the 'minimal' theme often achieved by overriding a layout.
# For simplicity, we'll try adding a custom 'navigation' section, which some variants of minimal might support, 
# or you can directly modify the theme's layout file (see notes below).
# The simplest approach is to modify the default Jekyll Page configuration.

# Let's try adding a simple 'contact_links' section - this requires a custom layout file
# but we will try to leverage the existing fields first.

# The location and email are often standard fields in the sidebar that you can set in your GitHub Profile settings.
# The 'minimal' theme usually pulls the name, location, and bio from your *GitHub user profile* itself,
# but for the explicit links you want, you may need to override the theme's `_layouts/default.html` file.
